Title: Epic 1 — Story 1.4: Set scoring and payoff

User story:
As a world creator, I want to define payoff and scoring so that rankings reflect my world.

Acceptance criteria:
- Payoff matrix editor with Prisoner’s Dilemma defaults; prevents missing cells.
- Scoring options: sum | average | discounted (gamma input shown only when selected).
- Function reference input visible but disabled (future use).

Technical notes:
- Update payoff (type, matrix) and scoring in schema_doc; validate matrix completeness.
