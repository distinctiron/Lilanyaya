Title: Epic 1 — Story 1.7: Seed baseline actors

User story:
As a world creator, I want baseline actors so that entrants have references.

Acceptance criteria:
- One‑click add Always Cooperate, Always Defect, Tit For Tat, Win‑Stay/Lose‑Shift.
- actor_strategy_mode governs whether duplicates are allowed.

Technical notes:
- Insert actors referencing builtin strategies; enforce uniqueness when one_to_one.
