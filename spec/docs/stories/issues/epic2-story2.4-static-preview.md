Title: Epic 2 — Story 2.4: Static preview (no compute)

User story:
As a creator, I want a static preview so that I can verify structure before spending runs.

Acceptance criteria:
- Behavior summary with validation results and, for Natural Language, state/transition diagram.
- No quota is consumed.

Technical notes:
- For Code mode, run static analysis only; no execution.
