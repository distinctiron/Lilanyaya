Title: Epic 3 — Story 3.3: Random schedule (seeded)

User story:
As a system, I need a random scheduler so that worlds can diversify interaction orders.

Acceptance criteria:
- Supports shuffle‑all and sample‑per‑round modes; both seeded.
- Switching modes is recorded in the run manifest; outputs remain reproducible.

Technical notes:
- Use seeded shuffles; ensure no duplicate or missing pairings per round.
