Title: Epic 1 — Story 1.6: Build Key Performance Indicators

User story:
As a world creator, I want to define Key Performance Indicators so that I can track important signals.

Acceptance criteria:
- Builder supports scope (world/actor/pair), filters, window, aggregation.
- Save/list/delete Key Performance Indicators per world.
- Latest run snapshot values rendered on the world page.

Technical notes:
- Persist to kpi_definitions; compute snapshots post‑run into kpi_snapshots.
