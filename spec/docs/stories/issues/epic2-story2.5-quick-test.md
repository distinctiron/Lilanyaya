Title: Epic 2 — Story 2.5: Quick Test (subscriber)

User story:
As a subscriber, I want a 10‑run quick test vs baselines so that I can gauge behavior fast.

Acceptance criteria:
- Deterministic seed used; per‑opponent mini‑cards show averages and outcome mix.
- Free users see a teaser with upgrade call to action.

Technical notes:
- Enqueue small run set; use baseline actors from the world.
