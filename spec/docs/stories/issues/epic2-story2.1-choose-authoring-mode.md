Title: Epic 2 — Story 2.1: Choose authoring mode (Natural Language | Code)

User story:
As a strategy creator, I want to choose Natural Language or Code at creation so that I can use the best tool for my skillset.

Acceptance criteria:
- Mode toggle is required on first save and becomes read‑only thereafter.
- UI adjusts fields and validation rules per mode.

Technical notes:
- Persist mode on strategies.type; enforce immutability after first save.
