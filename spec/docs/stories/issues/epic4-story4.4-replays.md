Title: Epic 4 — Story 4.4: Replays (subscriber)

User story:
As a subscriber, I want seeded replays so that I can inspect pivotal moments.

Acceptance criteria:
- Timeline with event markers (first D, forgiveness threshold, switches).
- Step controls; shows the seed and allows change when permitted.

Technical notes:
- Store sampled trace for selected pairs; derive event markers during trace save.
